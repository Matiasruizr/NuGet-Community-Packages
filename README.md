# NuGet Community Packages

A set of NuGet packages for common libraries that are maintained by the NuGet community, rather than the library authors themselves.

NOTE: This project contains the source of other OSS libraries, who in turn have their own licenses. This project is not re-licensing those libraries in any way, but rather hosting the libraries purely for the purpose of packaging them into NuGet packages that can be published to the public NuGet feed. Any custom code in this project (e.g. the nuspec files, automation scripts, etc.) is distributed under the license shown in the License tab.
